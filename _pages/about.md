Welcome. This a page about my (Yuchi TANG's) research, mostly, in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). 

I am recently pursuing my PhD degree within [Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/acse), [The University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/), while this PhD programme is cross-affiliated with [HELSI](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/healthy-lifespan). In this programme, we are studying explainable machine learning (a sub-topic in XAI) in healthcare-related tasks.
